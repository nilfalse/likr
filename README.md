## Introduction
The idea behind the game is very simple:
1. Two players get into the room;
1. Each round they are given 2 options;
1. Once both of them made their choices the game goes on to the next round;
1. Every next round continues with a new set of options;
1. After several iterations players get to know their statistical match.
